= Project: Monitor SparkFun Weather Station Kit with Arduino Cloud

This project shows how to create a weather station monitored by https://cloud.arduino.cc[Arduino Cloud].

No matter if you're an agriculturalist, a professional meteorologist, or simply a weather enthusiast, creating your own weather station can be an incredibly fulfilling endeavor. But when it comes to measuring weather accurately, you'll require some specialized sensors. With the combination of the https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16794[Sparkfun MicroMod Weather Carrier Board] and the https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15901[Sparkfun Weather Meter kit] you can build your own weather monitor station very easily.

== Prerequisites
. https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16781[SparkFun MicroMod ESP32 Processor]
. https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16794 [SparkFun MicroMod Weather Carrier Board]
  - It has a M.2 socket where the microprocessor board will be inserted
  - It includes the BME280 temperature, pressure and humidity sensor, the VEML6075 UV sensor and the AS3935 Lightning detector.
. https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15901[SparkFun Weather Meter Kit]
  - It includes the three fundamental components for weather measurement: wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall
. An https://cloud.arduino.cc/home/?get-started=true[Arduino Cloud account]

== Kit assembly
Follow these instructions to assemble the kit:
. Insert the MicroMod ESP32 Processor board into the M.2 socket of the carrier board
. Connect the carrier board to your computer using a USB-C cable
. Assemble the weather kit and connect it to the carrier board following the https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/weather-meter-hookup-guide?_gl=1*12fayw8*_ga*MzA0MDIyNDUzLjE2ODQ5NDA1OTA.*_ga_T369JS7J9N*MTY5MDk4ODM2OS43LjEuMTY5MDk4OTMwMy41OC4wLjA.&_ga=2.166871163.49634511.1690988369-304022453.1684940590[instructions]

== Installation
Although the full process of creating a device, thing and dashboard is described in the following https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/iot-cloud-getting-started[article] you can follow this simple instructions

. Open the Arduino Cloud https://create.arduino.cc/iot/devices[Devices tab] and add a Device
  - Follow the instructions to add the device and note down the Device ID and Key
. Open the Arduino Cloud https://create.arduino.cc/iot/things[Things tab] and add a Thing
  - Associate the previously created device
  - Add the variables listed in the *Variables* section
  - Configure the Network credentials and Device key obtained in the first step
. Open the Sketch tab (this is the _IoT Cloud editor_) and paste the content of the Spkfn_Weather_Station.ino file
  - Edit the line that includes the code `#define ARDUINO_CLOUD_PLAN    ARDUINO_CLOUD_PLAN_MAKER`
    * Set it to your plan: `ARDUINO_CLOUD_PLAN_FREE`, `ARDUINO_CLOUD_PLAN_ENTRY` or `ARDUINO_CLOUD_PLAN_MAKER`
. Click on *"Open full editor"*
  - Open the "Library Manager" in the "Libraries" tab
  - Search and mark as Favorite (click on the star) the following libraries:
    * SparkFun AS3935 Lightning Detector Arduino Library
    * SparkFun BME280 Arduino Library
    * SparkFun VEML6075 Arduino Library
    * SparkFun Weather Meter Kit Arduino Library
. Back in the _IoT Cloud Editor_, click on _Verify and Upload_

TIP: Instead of doing the process manually, you can create the Thing and Dashboard using the Cloud CLI and the templates that can be found in the *arduino-cloud* folder. More information in this https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/arduino-cloud-cli[article]


=== Variables
Create the variables according to the following rules:
[options="header",cols="6a,6a,6a,6a,6a,6a,6a"]
|===
|Name |Permission |Type |Update Parameter |Update Strategy |Variable Name| Starting Plan
|temperature |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |temperature |all
|rain |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |rain |all
|windDirection |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |windDirection |all
|windSpeed |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |windSpeed |all
|pressure |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |pressure |all
|soilMoisture |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |soilMoisture |Entry
|humidity |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |humidity |Entry
|lightningDistance |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |lightningDistance |Entry
|lightningOccurred |READ_ONLY |BOOLEAN |1 |TIMED |lightningOccurred |Entry
|uvIndex |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |uvIndex |Entry
|uva |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |uva |Maker
|uvb |READ_ONLY |FLOAT |1 |TIMED |uvb |Maker
|===

The _Starting Plan_ column indicates with which plans you can start using the variables. See the Note.
So, for example, you only have to create _uvIndex_ variable if you have an *Entry* or superior plan (*Entry*, *Maker* or *Maker+*).

.*Note on the maximum number of variables*
[NOTE]
===============================
Depending on your Arduino Cloud subscription, you have a limit on the number of maximum variables that you can configure.
[options="header"]
|===
|Plan |Max number of vars 
|Free |5
|Entry |10
|Maker | Unlimited
|Maker Plus | Unlimited
|===

Check the full list of supported features for each https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans[plan].
